Built this simple website that allows a Faculty/Supervisor to Add, view, update and delete record.
Language: HTML, PHP, CSS. (No Library or framework used)

When the table has had a valid record added, a webpage should be returned from the server that displays:
• The Student name and id.
• The score achieved for this attempt.
• The number of attempts the student has made doing the quiz.

Faculty can also do this:
• List all attempts.
• List all attempts for a particular student (given a student id OR name).
• List all students (id, first and last name) who got 100% on their first attempt.
• List all students (id, first and last name) got less than 50% on their second attempt.
• Delete all attempts for a particular student (given a student id).
• Change the score for a quiz attempt (given a student id and attempt number)
